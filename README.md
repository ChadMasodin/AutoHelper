# AutoHelper
I made a handy AHK script with a UI, that helps automate a number of routine processes in Vermintide 2:

- Salvage items of any rarity, including and red.
- Opening chests.
- Upgrading weapons / amulet for essence in Athanor.
- Crafting Mechanics (Convert Dust / Craft items and others).

## Usage
1) First, head over to this GitHub release listings page.
In the list of assets, select the archive with the required language: English (ENG) / Russian (RUS).
Unpack the archive to any place on your disk and install the program AutoHotKey v1.1.

2) Done, now you can run the AHK script and work in it.

3) After running the script, name the preset and save it, then open Explorer, type %appdata% in the address bar and press Enter. 
Go to the automatically created AutoHelper folder, where the presets file will be located. Next, from the downloaded archive, transfer the presets.ini file to the AutoHelper folder and confirm the replacement of the contents. _(This file contains pre-made presets for different screen resolutions)._

## How it works
I've written a separate guide in Steam on how to use it. Be sure to familiarize yourself with it so that you don't have any questions.
