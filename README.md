# AutoHelper
I made a handy AHK script called AutoHelper, which helps automate a number of routine processes in Vermintide 2:

- Salvage items of any rarity.
- Opening chests.
- Upgrading weapons or amulet for essence in Athanor.
- Reroll Properties for any item.
- Other crafting mechanics.

## Usage
1. First, go to the releases page [GitHub](https://github.com/ChadMasodin/AutoHelper/releases).
2. In the list of assets, select the archive with the desired game interface type (OLD UI) or (NEW UI) and language (ENG) or (RUS).
3. Unzip the archive to any location on your disk and install AutoHotKey v1.1.
4. Done, you can now run the AHK script itself and work with it.
5. After running the script, name the preset and save it.
6. Next, in the script folder, click on the shortcut %appdata% and go to the automatically created folder AutoHelper, the preset file will be located in it.
7. In the script folder, move the file presets.ini to the folder created by AutoHelper and confirm replacing the contents. (This file contains pre-made presets for different screen resolutions)

## How it works
I've written a separate guide in Steam on how to use it. Be sure to familiarize yourself with it so that you don't have any questions.
