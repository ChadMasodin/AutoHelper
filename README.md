# AutoHelper
I made a handy AHK script called AutoHelper, which helps automate a number of routine processes in Vermintide 2:

- Salvage items of any rarity.
- Opening chests.
- Upgrading weapons or amulet for essence in Athanor.
- Reroll Properties for any item.
- Other crafting functions.

## Installation
1. First, go to the releases page [GitHub](https://github.com/ChadMasodin/AutoHelper/releases).
2. Download the zip archive from the list of assets.
3. Unzip it to any location on the disk and install the <ins>AutoHotKey v1.1</ins>
4. After installing the program, go to the <ins>Presets</ins> folder and select the type of game interface that you are using, for example, <ins>FOR OLD UI</ins>.
5. In this folder, transfer the <ins>presets.ini</ins> file to the script directory and confirm the replacement of the contents. *(This file contains pre-made presets for different screen resolutions)*

## How it works
I've written a separate guide in Steam on how to use it. Be sure to familiarize yourself with it so that you don't have any questions.
