# AutoHelper
I made a handy AHK script with a UI, that helps automate a number of routine processes in Vermintide 2:

- Salvage items of any rarity, including and red.
- Opening chests.
- Upgrading weapons / amulet for essence in Athanor.
- Crafting Mechanics (Convert Dust / Craft items and others).
